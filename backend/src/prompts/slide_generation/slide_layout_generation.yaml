  LAYOUT DESIGN TASK:
  Create an optimal slide layout based on content analysis.

  CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
  {content}

  USER REQUIREMENTS:
  - Description: {description}
  - Available Media: {%- if has_images %}Images available{%- else %}Text content only{%- endif %}

  LAYOUT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Analyze the content to determine the best organizational structure
  2. Create sections that effectively present the key information
  3. Use visual hierarchy to guide audience attention
  4. Design for optimal content flow and comprehension
  5. Consider content type and create appropriate section types
  6. Ensure content is well-distributed across the slide

  CONTENT-BASED LAYOUT DECISIONS:
  - For data-heavy content: Use charts, bullet lists, and highlight boxes
  - For narrative content: Use text sections with compelling storytelling
  - For process content: Use timeline or process step sections
  - For comparison content: Use side-by-side sections
  - For key insights: Use highlight boxes and bullet lists

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
  Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, no code blocks):
  {
    "layout_type": "content_slide|key_insights|comparison|timeline|process|mixed",
    "title": "Clear, descriptive title based on content",
    "sections": [
      {
        "type": "text|bullet_list|highlight_box|timeline|process_step",
        "content": "Brief description of what this section will contain",
        "position": {"x": 5, "y": 25, "width": 45, "height": 35},
        "style": {"font_size": "18px", "color": "#2c3e50", "alignment": "left", "font_weight": "bold"}
      }
    ]
  }

  LAYOUT GUIDELINES:
  - Use 2-4 sections for optimal content distribution
  - Position sections to create visual flow (left to right, top to bottom)
  - Vary section types to maintain interest
  - Ensure adequate spacing between sections (at least 5% gap)
  - Make title prominent and descriptive
  - Focus on content organization, not visual styling

  IMPORTANT:
  - Layout decisions should be based on content analysis, not theme preferences
  - Theme information is for visual styling only, not layout design
  - Focus on organizing content effectively for audience comprehension
