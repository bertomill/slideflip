Create a professional PowerPoint slide in HTML format based on the following requirements:

SLIDE DESCRIPTION: $description

THEME: $theme

NUMBER OF SLIDES TO GENERATE: $slide_count

$content_plan$user_feedback$research_data$document_content$templates_content

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create $slide_count complete HTML slides that look professional and presentation-ready
2. Use modern CSS styling with the $theme theme consistently across all slides
3. Incorporate the research data naturally across the slides
4. Make each slide visually appealing with proper typography, spacing, and layout
5. Include relevant data points, statistics, or insights distributed across slides
6. Use a clean, readable design suitable for presentations
7. Ensure each slide is self-contained with scoped CSS that won't affect parent elements
8. Make each slide responsive and well-structured
9. CRITICAL: Design for 16:9 aspect ratio (PowerPoint slide dimensions) - each slide will be displayed in a container with 16:9 proportions
10. MULTIPLE SLIDES: Generate exactly $slide_count distinct slides with logical flow and progression. Each slide should focus on a specific aspect or section of the content, creating a cohesive presentation when viewed together.

ASPECT RATIO REQUIREMENTS:
// ============================================================================
// 16:9 ASPECT RATIO OPTIMIZATION: Critical design constraints for slide display
// ============================================================================
// The generated slide must work perfectly within a 16:9 aspect ratio container
// This ensures consistency between web preview and PowerPoint export formats
- Design the slide content to work optimally in a 16:9 aspect ratio container
- This matches standard PowerPoint slide dimensions (1920x1080, 1280x720, etc.)
- Content should be well-proportioned and not cramped when displayed in this format
- Use appropriate font sizes and spacing that work well in the 16:9 format
- Consider that the slide will be viewed at various sizes but always maintain 16:9 proportions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array containing $slide_count HTML slides. Each slide should be a complete, self-contained HTML document that can be embedded safely. Format as:

```json
{
  "slides": [
    "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><style>/* CSS for slide 1 */</style></head><body><div class=\"slide-main\"><!-- Slide 1 content --></div></body></html>",
    "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><style>/* CSS for slide 2 */</style></head><body><div class=\"slide-main\"><!-- Slide 2 content --></div></body></html>",
    "<!-- Continue for all $slide_count slides -->"
  ]
}
```

Each slide should be:
1. A complete HTML document with scoped CSS in the <head> (recommended for complex layouts)
2. Self-contained and embeddable without affecting parent page elements

CRITICAL CSS SCOPING REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL CSS must be scoped to prevent affecting the parent page
- If using a complete HTML document, scope all styles to a main container class
- If using a div container, scope all styles to that container class
- NEVER use global selectors like body, html, *, or unscoped element selectors
- Example: Use ".slide-container h1" instead of just "h1"
- Example: Use ".slide-container .title" instead of just ".title"

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Use professional fonts (Arial, Helvetica, or similar)
- CRITICAL: Ensure high contrast text - use dark text (#333333 or darker) on light backgrounds, never light grey text
- Main headings should be #1a1a1a or #000000 for maximum readability
- Body text should be #333333 minimum, never lighter than #555555
- Background colors should provide strong contrast with text
- Include appropriate margins, padding, and spacing optimized for 16:9 viewing
- Use bullet points, headings, and visual hierarchy effectively
- Incorporate any statistics or data points from the research prominently
- Make the layout clean and uncluttered, suitable for 16:9 presentation format
- Test color combinations for WCAG accessibility standards

SLIDE STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:
Each slide in the array should follow this structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.slide-main {{ 
  width: 100%; 
  height: 100%; 
  background: white; 
  padding: 40px; 
  box-sizing: border-box; 
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  display: flex;                    /* Enable flexbox layout for vertical centering */
  flex-direction: column;           /* Stack content vertically */
  justify-content: center;          /* Center content vertically in 16:9 container */
}}
.slide-main h1 {{ color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; }}
.slide-main p {{ color: #333333; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; }}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="slide-main">
  <!-- Specific slide content here -->
</div>
</body>
</html>

CONTENT DISTRIBUTION:
- Slide 1: Title/Introduction slide with overview
- Slide 2-N: Main content slides, each focusing on specific topics
- Final slide: Conclusion/summary if appropriate
- Distribute research data, statistics, and key points across slides logically
