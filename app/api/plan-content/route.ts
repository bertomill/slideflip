// CONTENT PLANNING API ENDPOINT
// ============================================================================
// This endpoint generates a structured content plan that acts as a bridge
// between user input and AI slide generation. It creates a collaborative
// planning document that users can review and modify before final slide creation.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Content Planning API Route Handler
 * 
 * Creates a detailed, structured content plan based on user inputs including:
 * - User's slide description and requirements
 * - Selected visual theme preferences
 * - Available research data from external sources
 * - Uploaded document context and count
 * 
 * The generated plan serves as a preview and allows users to provide feedback
 * before the final AI slide generation step.
 * 
 * @param request - Contains description, selectedTheme, hasResearch, researchData, documentCount
 * @returns JSON response with formatted content plan or error details
